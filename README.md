Description

This repository orchestrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow by including:

Datasets for training and evaluating disease-prediction models.

Notebooks that document exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.

Trained models ready for inference, stored in the models/ directory.

Backend logic implemented in app.py to power a web interface using templates/ and assets from static/.

Flow documentation in flow.txt, guiding users through the workflow steps.

Project deliverables, including a written Paper/ and a Presentation/, presumably for academic or demonstration purposes.

Features

Interactive web app capable of generating disease predictions from user input.

Clear separation of frontend (templates, static assets) and backend logic (app.py).

Educational and collaborative emphasis with notebooks, presentations, and written documentation.

│
├── Datasets/ – Raw and processed datasets used for modeling
├── Notebooks/ – Jupyter Notebooks: EDA, preprocessing, model training
├── Paper/ – Written documentation of project methodology
├── Presentation/ – Slides or visuals summarizing the project
├── models/ – Saved trained models for inference
├── static/ – Static assets: CSS, JavaScript, images
├── templates/ – HTML templates for rendering web pages

└── flow.txt – Textual outline of project workflow


##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.x  
- A virtual environment (recommended)  
- Flask (or other relevant web framework as seen in `app.py`)  

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mkp151203/Project_Exb_1.git
   cd Project_Exb_1


Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt  # If available; otherwise manually install Flask, pandas, scikit-learn, etc.


Launch the app

python app.py


Use the web interface
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 (or the appropriate port).

Workflow Overview

Refer to flow.txt for a step-by-step outline of the system's data flow—from dataset loading and preprocessing, through model training and saving, to serving predictions in the web app.

## ⚡ Getting Started  

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mkp151203/Project_Exb_1.git
cd Project_Exb_1

2️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


(If requirements.txt is missing, install Flask, pandas, scikit-learn manually.)

3️⃣ Run the backend server
python app.py

4️⃣ Access the web app

Open your browser and go to:

http://localhost:5000

📊 Workflow

Load dataset → preprocess → train ML models → save models (.pkl)

Web app loads saved models for predictions

User inputs health parameters via frontend forms

Predictions are displayed instantly on the web app

🎯 Future Improvements

Add more diseases for prediction

Deploy on Heroku / AWS / GCP

Enhance UI/UX with React or TailwindCSS

Integrate real-time data from wearables
